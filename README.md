# PhpReport

PhpReport is a web application for time tracking, which provides useful
statistics about users, projects, and more.

The application is focused on companies or any situation where multiple people
collaborate on a project. PhpReport allows managers to see project-level
statistics such as cost and deviation, as well as user-level statistics like
number of days worked and unused vacation days. In addition, it also includes
tools for scheduling projects using extreme programming (XP) methodologies.

PhpReport makes use of the framework Ext JS to provide a rich user interaction
with the web application.

Finally, PhpReport can communicate with external applications, like ERPs or
desktop tools for personal time-tracking, by means of plugin development or
through the exposed web services.
