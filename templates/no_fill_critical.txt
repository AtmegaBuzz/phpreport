Hello ###LOGIN###,

The last task you recorded in PHPReport was on ###LAST_TASK_DATE###.

This was a very long time ago, so please fill in your hours.

Recall that you should record your hours on a more timely maner.
As time passes, the accuracy of the recorded hours will suffer and some
information may be lost.

This situation should be fixed as soon as posible. Keep in mind that,
in a couple of days, the past month will be closed and you will not
be able to fill in hours but under special request to us.

If you are having issues filling hours, please let us know right away.

Best regards,

--
