Hello ###LOGIN###,

The last task you recorded in PHPReport was on ###LAST_TASK_DATE###.

In three days, you will have gone one month without reporting hours
in PHPReport. This is much more time than can be handled.

PHPReport automatically locks days more than one month in the past,
so in three days time, you will not be able to record hours for some
days that you have not filled in. In order to unlock these locked days
you will need to talk to the Project Managers to explain why you
failed to record hours for this month.

Best regards,

--
