Hello ###LOGIN###,

The last task you recorded in PHPReport was on ###LAST_TASK_DATE###.

This was a while ago. Recall that you should record your hours on a
more timely maner. As time passes, the accuracy of the recorded hours
will suffer and some information may be lost.

We encourage you to fix this situation as soon as posible. If you are having
issues filling hours, please let us know as soon as possible.

Best regards,
