Management of other entities
####################################

There are some other entities in PhpReport, not mentioned before, with their own
management interfaces.

Area creation, edition and deletion
=====================================

In the *Areas management* screen you will be able to create, edit and delete
cities. It can be accessed from the *Data management* menu, section *Areas*.

This is a very simple interface in which you will see a grid containing the list
of areas stored in the system, sorted by *name*.

To create a new area you must use the *Add* button located above the grid,
and to edit an area you must double-click on the corresponding row.
In both cases, an inline edition row will appear; the only editable field is the
name of the area.

To delete an area you must select it with a single click on the corresponding
row and use the *Delete* button located next to *Add* button. You will be asked
for confirmation before actually trying to delete. If there are any users or
projects assigned to that area, you won't be allowed
to delete it. You have to remove these associations and try the deletion later.

Extra hours compensation creation, edition and deletion
=======================================================

In the *Hour compensations management* screen you will be able to create, edit
and delete extra hours compensations.
It can be accessed from the *Data management* menu, section *Hour compensations*.

To create a new compensation you must use the *Add* button located above the grid,
and to edit a compensation you must double-click on the corresponding row.
In both cases, an inline edition row will appear, where you can edit the fields
*date*, *user* and *hours*.

To delete a compensation you must select it with a single click on the corresponding
row and use the *Delete* button located next to *Add* button. You will be asked
for confirmation before actually trying to delete.
